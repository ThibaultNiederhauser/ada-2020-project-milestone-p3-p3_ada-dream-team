# P3 Milestone submission: Friendship distribution in function of the home position
### 1. Abstract:
Our project extension aims to inspect the difference in quantity and distribution of friends according to where a person lives. Cultural factors, as well as geography and politic decisions, may influence the result. We will analyse the problem inside Switzerland.
To do so, we will use BrightKite and Gowalla dataset. From these datasets, we will compute users friend's distribution and region membership. With these data, we will be able to assert (or no) the significance of regional disparities. We will inspect further what is the cause of it using another dataset that includes characteristics of each region (mobility, wealth, ...). 
To verify our findings, we will do the same analysis in Spain and compare the outcomes.
By doing this study, we may find some features that increase the number of friends or bring them closer, which may be solutions against the threat of depression and isolation augmentation.
### 2. Research Questions:
1. Is there differences in terms of friendship distribution in function of Switzerland's regions?
2. What are the factors that favour a higher number of friends? What are the factors that favour closer friends?
3. Are the conclusion done for Switzerland relevant to another country (Spain)?
### 3. Proposed dataset:
1. Gowalla dataset: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html. A dataset from the paper. Check-ins of users and friends relationship.
2. Brightkite dataset: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-Brightkite.html. A dataset from the paper. Check-ins of users and friends relationship.
3. Regional comparison of selected indicators, 2020, cantons: https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/regional-statistics/regional-portraits-key-figures/cantons.assetdetail.11587770.html. Characteristics of each Swiss canton, data compiled by the Swiss Confederation.
4. We did not find such regional comparison as we did for Switzerland. However, the National Institute of Statistics (https://www.ine.es/index.htm) has much different comparison by "Autonomous region". Once we know which are the essential features for Switzerland, we will be able to find them for each region on this webpage. If we are not able to find all we will easily find another country that has the data.
### 4. Methods:
1. Classification/Regression (try to predict the belonging)
2. Matching (match people that are comparable in scale in terms of number of friends/distribution)
### 5. Proposed timeline:
1. Find the disparities between the cantons
2. Find the main factors that influence these disparities
3. Compile data for Spain
4. Modify Spain and Switzerland data to be comparable
5. See if the same conclusions handle for Spain
### 6. Organisation within the team:
A. Do the project
T. Verify the project
