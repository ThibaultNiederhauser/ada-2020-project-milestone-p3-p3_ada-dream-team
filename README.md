# P3 Milestone submission: Friendship distribution in function of the home position
### 1. Abstract:
Our project extension aims to inspect the difference in quantity, quality and distribution of friends according to where a person lives. Cultural factors, as well as geography and political decisions, may influence the result. We will analyse the problem in different countries.
To do so, we will use BrightKite and Gowalla datasets. From them, we will compute users' nationalities and friendships characteristics such as proximity, quantity of friends and frequency of meeting. With these data, we will be able to assert (or no) the significance of regional disparities. We will inspect further what is the cause of it using another dataset that includes characteristics of each country (mobility, wealth, ...). 
By doing this study, we may find the factors that increase the number of friends or bring them closer, which may be solutions against the threat of depression and isolation augmentation.
### 2. Research Questions:
1. Is there differences in terms of friendship characteristics depending on the country?
2. What are the factors that impact the number of friends? 
3. What are the factors that impact the proximity of friends?
4. What are the factors that impact the quality of friendships?
5. Is there a relation between the number and quality of friendships?
### 3. Proposed dataset:
1. Gowalla dataset: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html. A dataset from the paper. Checkins of users and friends relationship.
2. Brightkite dataset: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-Brightkite.html. A dataset from the paper. Checkins of users and friends relationship.
3. COUNTRY DATASET
### 4. Methods:
1. Mapping (home position to country belonging)
2. Classification/Regression (try to predict the belonging or the characteristics when belonging to one country)
3. Matching (match people and countires that are comparable)
### 5. Proposed timeline:
1. Find the disparities between the cantons
2. Find the main factors that influence these disparities
3. Compile data for Spain
4. Modify Spain and Switzerland data to be comparable
5. See if the same conclusions handle for Spain
### 6. Organisation within the team:
A. Do the project
T. Verify the project
ID. Drink tea
### 7. Questions to TA's
